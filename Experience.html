                <p class="smleduu">In this, I've assisted with some development of an alternative way to visualize and analyze share price data for their traders â€“ this will alert them of potential trading opportunities.</p>

                <p class="smleduu">For this project, a trader from the equities team (publicly listed company stocks) has requested functionality be added to their dashboard to allow them to input specific information so they can monitor a new trading strategy.</p>

                <p class="smleduu">In order to do this, we made a setup in our system so that we can interface with the relevant financial data feed, make the required calculations and then present this in a way that allows the traders to visualize and analyze this data in real-time. For this, the visualization of charts and data analysis their trader's see is all built on JPMorgan Chase's own open-sourced software called Perspective.</p>
